# stepper Library

A extensible Library to control a stepper motor.

## Instructions to use as a Arduino Library

Inside your arduino sketchbook, create a folder called library if one doesn't exist.
Then create a folder inside of that folder called stepper. If you clone this repository inside the 
folder entitled stepper then an Arduino IDE should pick up on both the library to import as a library and the example.
